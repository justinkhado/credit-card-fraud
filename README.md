# credit-card-fraud
The goal of this project was to create a model that could predict credit card fraud. The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle and can
found inside the Jupyter notebook in this repository. The data was read using Pandas and visualized using Seaborn. Some of the 
columns were standardized using sci-kit learn's StandardScaler. The data was then trained and tested using a logistic regression
algorithm. Because of the large imbalance of the data, the model was trained on upsampled data and downsampled data as well.
